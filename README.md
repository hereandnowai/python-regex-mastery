## üöÄ Overview

Unlock the power of text manipulation with Regular Expressions! From validating complex data inputs to extracting precise information from vast datasets, regex is an indispensable tool in any developer's arsenal. This tutorial breaks down complex concepts into digestible lessons, ensuring a smooth learning curve.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

Upon completing this tutorial, you will be proficient in:

-   **Understanding Core Concepts:** Grasping the fundamental building blocks of regular expressions.
-   **Python `re` Module Mastery:** Effectively utilizing Python's built-in `re` module for diverse text processing tasks.
-   **Pattern Construction:** Building sophisticated regex patterns using advanced features like groups, lookarounds, and backreferences.
-   **Real-World Application:** Applying regex to solve common challenges such as data validation (emails, phone numbers) and text parsing.
-   **Performance Optimization:** Learning techniques to write efficient and performant regex patterns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

Getting started is quick and easy!

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hereandnowai/regex-mastery-tutorial.git
    cd regex-mastery-tutorial
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (highly recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

## üìñ Topics Covered

### Basics of Regex in Python

Dive into the foundational elements of regex:

-   `re.match`, `re.search`, `re.findall`, `re.split`, `re.sub` for common operations.
-   **Character Classes:** `\d` (digits), `\w` (word characters), `\s` (whitespace), `.` (any character).
-   **Quantifiers:** `*` (zero or more), `+` (one or more), `?` (zero or one), `{n}` (exactly n), `{n,}` (n or more), `{n,m}` (between n and m).
-   **Anchors:** `^` (start of string/line), `$` (end of string/line).

### Intermediate Regex Concepts

Elevate your regex skills with:

-   **Grouping and Capturing:** Using `()` to group patterns and capture matched text.
-   **Named Groups:** Assigning names to groups with `?P<name>...` for clearer code.
-   **Lookarounds:** Mastering Positive/Negative Lookahead and Lookbehind for conditional matching without consuming characters.
-   **Greedy vs. Lazy Quantifiers:** Understanding how quantifiers behave and controlling their matching behavior.
-   **Regex Flags:** Utilizing `re.IGNORECASE`, `re.MULTILINE`, `re.DOTALL` to modify regex behavior.

### Advanced Regex Techniques

Explore the sophisticated side of regex:

-   **Backreferences:** Reusing previously captured groups with `\1` or `\g<name>`.
-   **Recursive Patterns:** (Brief introduction/conceptual understanding for complex nested structures).
-   **Regex for Validation:** Practical examples for validating common data formats like Emails, Phone Numbers, and URLs.
-   **Performance Tuning and Debugging Regex:** Strategies to write efficient patterns and troubleshoot issues.

### Hands-on Exercises

Put your knowledge to the test with a series of practical problems, categorized by difficulty. Each exercise includes example input and expected output to guide your learning.

### Solutions

Access well-commented, working solutions to all exercises. Use them to verify your understanding or to learn alternative approaches.
